### Known issues
* **Read-Only:** This plugin currently only displays Kick chat messages. You cannot send messages through Chatterino.

* **Unofficial API:** This plugin relies on Kick's internal API and WebSocket structure, which Kick could change at any time without notice, potentially breaking the plugin.

* **No Emotes/Badges:** No emotes or user badges are displayed. Only plain text is shown.

* **Looks bad:** Chat messages are gray and might be hard to read.

### Disclaimer
* This was made primarily with AI and prompt engineering.
